`i3-theme-manager` is a simple script with an optional graphical interface to create loadable theme packages consisting
the various components of your chosen theme. A package consists of: 
1. i3 configuation 
2. status bar configuation
3. terminal emulator configuration 
4. vim configuartion
5. gtk themes/icons/cursors
6. bash configuaration + aliases
7. wallpaper configuartion

For certain theme components like wallpaper setters and terminal emulators, `i3-theme-manager` only supports selected programs,
but will eventually support more in the future.
