`i3-theme-manager` is a simple script with an optional graphical interface to create loadable theme packages consisting
the various components of your chosen theme. A package consists of: 
    1. i3 configuation 
    2. status bar configuation
    3. terminal emulator configuration 
    4. vim configuartion
    5. gtk themes/icons/cursors
    6. bash configuaration + aliases
    7. wallpaper configuartion

For certain theme components like wallpaper setters and terminal emulators, `i3-theme-manager` only supports selected programs,
but will eventually support more in the future.

Both the CLI tool and GUI component require Python 3.

For the GUI component of `i3-theme-manager` to work correctly, you will need to have `pyqt5`
which can be installed by:
